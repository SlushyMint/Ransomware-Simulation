# Ransomware Simulation
This is my first ever cyber security related project that i have done. The reason why i made this project is because i want to try to educate people of the importance of their device security. 
Once i learned on how ransomware works, i tried to simulate it through this educational ransomware simulation program. As we know, cyber crime in this time is a concern to the public and understanding 
how cyber crime is essential.
