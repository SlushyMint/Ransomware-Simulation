# Ransomware Simulation
This is my first ever cyber security related project that i have done. The reason why i made this project is because i want to try to educate people of the importance of their device security. 
Once i learned on how ransomware works, i tried to simulate it through this educational ransomware simulation program. As we know, cyber crime in this time is a concern to the public and understanding 
how cyber crime work is essential. 

# Features
- Friendly and interesting user interface
- Simulating a realistic situation
- Using real method of cryptography encryption

# How it works

This is going to be the first look of the program for the user, in order to start the simulation. You have to press the "Simulate Encryption" button to start. Also, when you start the program a new folder will appear with the name "simulation_folder" that is filled with "important data".

Once you've pressed the button, a new window will appear and it's a fake payment window that you have to input in order to get the decryption key. Once, you done inputting all the "Credit Card Information" just press the "Pay Now" button to proceed.

Once the process is done, you'll get a decryption key and just copy it. Then after that, press the "Simulate Decryption" button in the main window, once you press it a small window will appear, asking you for the decryption key and you just need to put the key.

Congrats! You just passed the ransomware simulation and all of your data now are restore :)
